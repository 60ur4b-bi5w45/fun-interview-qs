### 1. **`console.log(false == [])`**

#### Output:
```
true
```

#### Detailed Explanation:
1. **`==` Operator (Equality with Type Coercion):**
   - The `==` operator in JavaScript performs type coercion, meaning it converts the operands to a common type before comparing them.

2. **Step-by-Step Evaluation:**
   - On the left-hand side, we have `false` (a boolean value).
   - On the right-hand side, we have `[]` (an empty array).
   - When comparing a boolean with a non-boolean, JavaScript converts both to a common type:
     - `false` becomes `0` (a number).
     - The empty array `[]` is converted to an empty string `""`, which is then coerced to `0` (a number).

3. **Final Comparison:**
   - The comparison effectively becomes:
     ```javascript
     0 == 0
     ```
   - This evaluates to `true`.

#### Key Note:
If you used the strict equality operator (`===`), the output would be `false` because `false` (boolean) and `[]` (object) are of different types, and no type coercion happens.

### 2. **`console.log(false == ![])`**

#### Output:
```
true
```

#### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Evaluate `![]`:**
   - The `!` (logical NOT) operator converts its operand into a boolean and then negates it.
   - `[]` (an empty array) is a "truthy" value in JavaScript.
   - Applying `!` to a truthy value results in `false`.

   So, `![]` evaluates to `false`.

2. **Expression Becomes:**
   - After evaluating `![]`, the expression simplifies to:
     ```javascript
     false == false
     ```

3. **Equality Check with `==`:**
   - Here, both sides are already `false` (boolean values), so no type coercion is needed.

4. **Final Result:**
   - `false == false` evaluates to `true`.

---

### Key Takeaways:
- **Type coercion** is a key concept in JavaScript's `==` operator.
- Arrays (even empty ones) are "truthy," but when coerced to strings, they become `""`.
- Logical operations like `!` first convert values to booleans before negating them.
